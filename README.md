# HinataBot
Hinata is a unique for bot all the hentai, anime loving weebs.\
Based in discord.py with a backend in node.js, Hinata is fast responding and useful for your everday needs.

## Setting Up
Assuming you're an active developer (or) have somehow obtained the source code most likely by a repo leak, here's how to set it up, lol.

If you're running this on a VPS, use Python3.8 and pip3.\
Run the following command in your linux environment to install all requirements that Hinata depends on.

```sudo -h pip3 install -r requirements.txt```\
When this command is executed, make sure you're in the root directory of the bot's source.\
Then run the following.\
```python3.8 launcher.py```
\
This *should* work.
